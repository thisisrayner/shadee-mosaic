# Handover Report: The YouTube Ingestion Gap
**Date:** 2025-12-27
**Subject:** Missing YouTube narratives in `social_posts` table.

## 1. Current State
As of the Phase 2 audit, the "Internal Brain" (Vector Store) is technically functional but data-impoverished regarding YouTube.

- **Total Records in `social_posts`:** 55,607
- **Reddit:** 42,335
- **Tumblr:** 12,764
- **YouTube:** **195** (Massive deficit identified)
- **Telegram:** 0

## 2. Technical Audit Results
I have verified the following using the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`:
- **Schema Check:** No tables named `youtube_comments`, `youtube_data`, or `narratives` exist in the `public` schema.
- **Ingestion Search:** No ingestion scripts (e.g., `googleapiclient` or `weekly_report.py`) were found in the current working directory.
- **RAG Readiness:** The 195 YouTube rows are successfully indexed and searchable. The issue is **Quantity**, not **Logic**.

## 3. The Hypothesis
The bulk YouTube data is likely residing in:
1.  A separate Supabase project/schema not yet connected.
2.  A local CSV/JSON store mentioned in historical context (e.g., related to `weekly_report.py`).
3.  An external Daily Social Listening tool that is failing to push to the `social_posts` table.

## 4. Instructions for Next Agent
Please verify the following:
1.  **Locate Ingestion Source:** Find the script responsible for "YouTube Social Listening". 
2.  **Schema Access:** Check if there are other schemas (besides `public`) in the current Supabase project that might hold YouTube data.
3.  **Backfill Protocol:** Once found, use `src/data/bulk_anonymizer.py` and `src/ai/indexer.py` to ingest, scrub, and index the missing rows.
