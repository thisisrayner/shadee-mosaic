But I want to. I want to enjoy life, have hobbies, find purpose, make friends, etc.

I just can't climb out of this hole.

31F. I have rheumatoid arthritis which is an autoimmune disease. Lately, it's been flaring up, and I'm in a lot of pain. My house is a mess because it hurts to move. I've also been having digestive issues for about a year now. I've lost about 20 pounds. It's noticeable. I don't eat, because it triggers the symptoms. The holidays are almost here and the thought of eating around my parents scare me, because I know how my stomach will react. At least when I'm at home I can freak out in private. I hate food but I'm so hungry. Thing is, I know I should go to the doctor, but I just don't care about my life anymore.

Prior to this, I've been depressed and anxious my entire life. I actually think it triggered my autoimmune disease. I've never been in a serious relationship, even though people think I'm pretty and tend to like and think well of me. Never had any deep friendships. A few months ago, I also found out I have autism, which explains my difficulty with socializing and connection. I found an online community and I've made 3 friends from there but it's all long distance and I wouldn't say we're close at all. I'm grateful for them just helping to keep me afloat. However, I still spend 95% of my time alone because I work from home and just don't leave the house unless I have to.

I was sheltered growing up and have trouble relating to a lot of people's experiences. I feel like a girl trapped in an adult body, and honestly, I look and sound young for my age. After I got diagnosed with RA, I started having an existential and faith crisis and got desperate for any kind of connection and made some poor judgment decisions. I almost deconstructed this year completely, but I figure if I can't have hope in this life, maybe I can aim for the next one. To sum it up, if I am really ill, like terminally ill, I'll be scared but I don't know I'd want to get treated. I'm scared to suffer and die but I'm tired of living. I regret wasting so much of my life depressed and it took getting sick to realize it.

I'm not saying any of this to generate pity. I'm just trying to present where I'm at. One of the friends I mentioned helped me to reframe my mindset so I don't fall into the victim mentality trap. He says I choose not to do xyz instead of I can't do xyz. I know I can't control what happens to me or change the past, but I can choose what to do next. It's just...I don't know what to do next or even if it's worth fighting for...is my life even worth it? I'm truly drowning.

Hello,

  
I am 34 years old. 2 years ago, almost to the day, my 8 year relationship came to an end. After 10 months, we got back together, only for him to break up again with me in February this year because I was sick too much - I had flu, followed by Shingles... He refused to move out of the house we own together and I've been trapped here. Madly in love. 

  
He's been emotionally abusive, something he was never in the past. Constantly telling me that we ""might"" get back together, suggesting he ""might"" love me. Then he would constantly pull it all away and watch me crumble and then use the way I react (i.e., crying, depression, asking questions about why he treats me like this) as a reason for ""why"" we would never fix things. He gaslights me - he will literally try and tell me words have different meanings; one time literally trying to convince me that ""yes"" meant ""no"". 

  
Last Christmas, we'd been back together for nearly 2 months. We planned on spending Christmas together, but 2 days before the day, his mum called and basically emotionally blackmailed him - ""it could be your grandma's last Christmas"", etc. It hurt, but I encouraged him to go and leave me alone. I didn't want that hanging over our new relationship - especially in the event she did die. Spoiler: She didn't. 

  
This year I'm alone again. My own doing, I guess. We have a dog who isn't good around people. We couldn't really take him to either family because of young children. So I agreed I'd stay at home. Personally, I don't think I should have been put in this position. We still live together and he knows how much last year hurt me. Why wouldn't he just stay here with me? I thought I'd be find, but I can't stop crying. I'm pathetic. 34. No real friends. Nothing. I thought maybe he'd come back at New Years, and he keeps saying he'll ""think about"", but I know he won't. I know deep down he won't. and I can't stop crying about it. 

  
Why can't I stop loving him? He's said it all. I'm ugly. Pathetic. He never loved me, etc etc. These comments all haunt me (especially because my first relationship - also of 8 years (although our relationship has now spanned 10 years, I guess - also ended with him telling me I was ugly and he never found me attractive, etc). Genuinely haunt me. I'm becoming a shell of myself and can barely look at myself in the mirror. 

  
34 years of life and in 12 months, when my fixed term mortgage is up, I will have nothing to show for it. I can't afford to buy the property myself. I live in London. I can't afford to stay alone. I'm a teacher, so can't work from home. I'm alone. and in 12 months, I will lose everything. My home. My job. My dog. My love. 

  
I don't remember what it's like to be happy anyone. All everyone tells me is how sad I am.

  
I don't know the point of this post. I just feel so lonely. So pathetic. Desperate.

I graduated with a comp sci degree in the UK around 6 months ago and have just been bed rotting ever since, except for a part time job at a bar which is minimum wage and barely gives me any hours. I hated the degree and just stuck with it because I had no idea what else I wanted to do and I was already too far deep. 

For the last 6 months I’ve been procrastinating applying for jobs, I have no internships and I know I suck at coding and don’t have a passion for it so I thought why apply if I know I’d just fail all the interviews anyway, that’s if I could get lucky enough to even land an interview. I’d take any kind of job where having any sort of degree would be useful but I have no idea where to look.

I have no friends, never been in a relationship, and I’m 23 because I had to retake 2 years of education. I lost all my friends from high school and that was difficult but my university friends helped me fill that void. Now all my university friends have graduated and moved back to their home towns and while I try to keep contact, I have no friends that I can see on a regular basis. 

I spend most the day on my phone doomscrolling, I want to put the phone down but I have no idea what I’d be doing if I wasn’t on my phone. I know this is ridiculous to say because 23 isn’t that old but I just feel like I’m at the end of life currently. I do nothing but exist, I’ve got no friendships, no relationship, no purpose and there’s nothing that I’m currently building or working towards. I’m just here without a clue what to do with myself. 

Spending so much time isolated has ruined my social skills, I can barely hold a conversation, I stutter on my words and I can barely keep eye contact. I hate being completely self aware of how awkward I’m being when talking to people but still not being able to do anything about it anyway. I just think if my younger self saw me now how disappointed he’d be. I can’t remember the last time I genuinely laughed or was happy. 

Luckily I have good family around me, because ultimately if they weren’t there and I had nobody to live for I probably would’ve ended it by now. My parents keep asking me about how the job search is going and my stomach sinks every time they do because I lie and tell them how I’m trying but I know deep down I’ve barely been trying and just procrastinating it. 

I think about how when my parents were my age they were already married, already had good jobs and already had children. Here I am thinking at the same age they achieved all that I’ve achieved nothing, I could never provide a child the same childhood they provided me. I hate being lonely and I hate being a failure. 

I try not to think about the time wasted in the last 5 years just lying in bed all day scrolling through my phone or playing video games while not doing anything productive. I know I’m still young but if I don’t find some motivation or a path forward I’ll end up reaching 40 with the exact same issues.",other,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ptw0et/spend_my_days_bed_rotting_and_dont_know_what_to/,{},2025-12-27T21:24:46.915936+00:00,depression_misery,"The user describes bed rotting, lack of purpose, social isolation, and feelings of failure after graduating.",0.95,False,,,

My guess is that I am one of the weakest-willed people in the world. Some of the people on this page are going through some crazy shit if the stories are to be believed, and I have no reason to doubt them. There are hundreds of millions of people in the world who suffer from a loss of a loved one, a parent, a child, homelessness, terminal illness, and other sick shit brought into the world by the loving and ever so righteous God, according to some. I'm so sure it's part of his grand plan that we can't hope to comprehend. In contrast, what has happened to me that led to me posting here? The same thing that happened to a billion other people. A heartbreak. Compared to the issues of other people it feels funny trying to put my situation at the same level of ""hitting rock bottom"". I probably had it easy my entire life, and now that this, for some nothing more than unpleasant situation, happened, I don't know how to react.

Anyway, my (24 M) only ever girlfriend of 4 years left me for another dude she saw irl for the first time two weeks before the breakup. She told me that she was unhappy with me for longer time. Too bad everytime I asked, everything was okay, and I was too stupid to notice the unspoken signals. I don't think all of the blame falls on her as I definitely wasn't an ideal partner, far from it. Obviously I was too dumb to notice and too lazy to do anything about it until it was too late. At the same time, I don't believe all of the blame is on me. I also hate that prick of taking advantage of our falling-apart (back then still without my knowledge) relationship as I considered him a friend before that, and I don't believe that she simply fell in love with him without him trying anything. Then again, I didn't know him too well either, but I trusted him because he was a nice guy ever since I remembered. Regardless of how it actually happened I consider what he did a stab in the back. All in all a pretty normal life situation that happened to countless people before me, and to top it all off at least half of it was caused by me just being a shitty person, so why am I even complaining? First of all, I just can't get over her. The truth is that regardless of how she felt I loved her very much. I thought she loved me too (as she claimed), so the breakup came to me as a surprise. Regardless of what I was doing, I was happy just knowing I had her in my life and I would see her in the evening. I loved just being close to her, what we did together didn't even matter to me that much. The same way, no matter what I do now, I always feel empty. Nothing brings me joy. I started exercising again after six years, even picked up swimming, and trying to meet new people. Yet, no matter what I do, I do not feel joy from anything. I even tried therapy, but to be honest I don't even know if it helped or not. It probably helped at the very start, when I was incapable of doing anything, including work, and had to take PTO for like the first week after the breakup. Talking about it to therapist to some extent allowed me to at least be able to work. But in the end, I don't think I conveyed everything I wanted to, because I'm just so fucking embarrassed about my feelings. Second of all, number one thing everyone says whevener you go through a breakup is ""it gets better"", and supposedly in most of the cases it does. However; I am the only person on the planet who wasn't born clairvoyant. I don't think that getting a girlfriend is a given for me, much less a person that I can love and that will love me back. I am as big of an introvert as they come. I can't even talk to girls irl because I'm so fucking socially awkward it's ridiculous even to me. Me getting together with my now ex was a fucking fluke in the first place. We met in a game of all places, and I have absolutely no fucking clue how I mustered the courage to ask her out after like a year of playing together. That kind of thing just doesn't happen twice. Not to say I stopped playing videogames altogether because not only it's not fun anymore, it also brings back memories of her. Also, I somehow mastered what I call the art of ""becoming a ghost"". Different from ghosting, I observe this phenomenon on myself during any and all social gatherings that I muster up the courage to go to. Not only do I not talk to anyone around me because I'm too fucking socially awkward (also can't get myself interested in anything that they talk about), but also no one talks to me ever, as if there was just empty chair and not a person. Yes, it is the effect of me not engaging in conversions, but it's gotten so ridiculous that I've started to view it as  a superpower, be it one of the worst you can get. So yeah, I want to be loved but do absolutely nothing to allow others to even get to know me. Who the fuck wants someone who is unable to feel happy anyway. I'm the worst, sorriest piece of shit there is and I hate myself. If there is a God, then I don't believe he is merciful nor good, otherwise he wouldn't have made a sorry piece of shit like me.

Breakup is supposedly a normal part of life, and I am well aware that it is far from the worst things that can and will happen. Yet it got me falling like a house of cards. Which is also why I am posting it here. At this point it's probably too long and insignificant for anyone to read, except for people who might get a kick out of it. Anyway I would probably never say all this to anyone face to face or anyone I know because I'm just too fucking embarrassed. I'm too soft and too damaged to be happy in this fucking world. Won't end it either because first of all I'm too much of a pussy to do that and second of all I love my family and wouldn't want them to be sad. Guess I'm just gonna continue living my fucking sorry life without any purpose and any glimpse of happiness whatsoever.

I don't really expect anyone to reply to this but if you decide to do so for whatever reason then PLEASE don't say fucking shit like ""You have your whole life ahead of you."" I obviously know that. It also does absolutely nothing to prevent me from feeling like the sorriest shit.",other,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ptqk6c/i_wish_i_wasnt_born/,{},2025-12-27T21:24:46.915936+00:00,depression_misery,"The user expresses a wish of not being born, and relates this feeling to a recent heartbreak and struggles with social interaction and finding happiness.",0.95,False,,,
